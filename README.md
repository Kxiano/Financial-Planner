<br/>

<p>Planner is a full-featured personal finance management application that helps you keep your financial life organized without needing a finance degree. Built with modern web technologies, it provides real-time insights into your income, expenses, investments, and overall financial health through an intuitive dashboard interface.</p>

<p><strong>Think of it as your financial command center - minus the stress of staring at endless Excel rows.</strong></p>

<br/>

<h2>🤔 Why Does This Exist?</h2>

<p>Let's be honest: most finance apps either look like they were designed in 1999 or they're so overloaded with features that you need a manual just to log a coffee purchase. We built Planner because:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Personal finance shouldn't be intimidating</strong> - Clean UI, straightforward metrics, no BS</li>
  <li><strong>You deserve to see your money in real-time</strong> - Dynamic charts that actually update when your financial situation changes</li>
  <li><strong>Privacy matters</strong> - Your financial data stays with you, not scattered across third-party servers (looking at you, random fintech startups)</li>
  <li><strong>Customization is key</strong> - Multi-currency support, flexible expense tracking, and adaptable to different financial goals</li>
</ul>

<p>The project started as a way to solve our own problem: wanting a finance tracker that didn't make us feel like we needed an accounting certification to use it.</p>
